## Setup environment (Task 1 & 2)
```bash
..\> pip3 install -r .\requirements.txt
```

---

## Task 1: Text Classification
Enter the commands below to run Task 1
##### Note: It is expected that the dataset for Task 1 is in the working directory (Task 1\data\BBC\\..)
```bash
..\> cd Task 1
..\Task 1\> python3 t1.py
```
After the successful completion of t1.py the three (3) output files will be generated in the current working directory

## Task 2: Drug Classification
Enter the commands below to run Task 2
##### Note: It is expected that the dataset for Task 2 is in the working directory (Task 2\data\drug200.csv)
```bash
..\> cd Task 2
..\Task 2\> python3 t2.py
```
After the successful completion of t2.py the three (3) output files will be generated in the current working directory
